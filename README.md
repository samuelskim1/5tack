# **5tack** #

5tack is a web application designed to help gamers connect based on similar interests and availability.

## **Background and Overview** ##
***

The inspiration behind 5tack originates largely from rapidly growing online multiplayer games and takes into account the busy lives of individuals around the world. In a majority of these games, players have the important option of playing with or against friends. However, a common issue that all gamers have faced at one point or another is the lack of available friends with whom to play. This can be frustrating because simply relying on a gameâ€™s matching algorithm to provide you with random teammates may lead to uncooperative, unpleasant, or even toxic teams to be formed. 

5tack is a platform where gamers can circumvent this frustration by detailing their specific requirements for both gaming experience and availability. In addition to networking, 5tack users may also leave reviews for players with which they connected. This feature is vital for games that are poorly moderated and serves to improve the integrity of the gaming community by holding players accountable for their actions and behaviors. 

## **Running the Development Server** ##
***
- Backend: `npm run dev`
- Frontend: `npm run start`

Note: `cd` into the correct folders first

## **Functionality & MVP** ##
***

- User authentication: sign up, log in, and log out
- Profiles: username, gaming handle(s), bio/description, rating

## **Technologies & Technical Challenges** ##
***

**Backend: MongoDB/Express**
The backend of our project will be developed using MongoDB and Express.js frameworks. 

MongoDB will be used to store and manage user profile information, reviews, ratings, and posts. 

Express.js will be used to build the API that communicates with the frontend and manages the necessary CRUD operations for profiles, reviews, ratings, and posts.

The backend will support the following features:
Management of creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users, reviews and ratings, posts, and categories.

**Technical Challenges:**

- The challenge lies in establishing a secure and reliable connection between the application and the backend API, ensuring data is properly sent, stored, and retrieved.
- The challenge involves effectively organizing data, learning Express.js, and preventing performance issues such as n+1 query problems.

**Frontend: React/Node.js**
- Our project will utilize React/Redux in order to create a more predictable and traceable workflow through having a single source of truth. 
- We will be using Node.js in order to take advantage of Javascript's asynchronicity to circumvent the blocking problem in processing non-JS operations.

**Technical Challenges:**

 - Fetching data from MongoDB and restructuring information for display and interaction
WebSockets API:
    - In order to provide a better user experience, we will incorporate real-time communication between users through WebSockets.
After an initial handshake, websockets then establish a two-way, persistent connection that either side can use to send data at any time.
